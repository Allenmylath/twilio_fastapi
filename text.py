NICE Guidelines
Jessica needs to know all of this: Overview | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder:

Right to choose
Care ADHD have recently been award an NHS contract which mean we can assess and
treat people under the right to choose agenda. The Right to Choose system in England
is designed to give patients greater autonomy over their healthcare by allowing them to
select where they receive outpatient care. This initiative ensures that patients can make
informed choices about their treatment while adhering to established clinical
guidelines.
To use the Right to Choose, a patient must first be registered with an NHS General
Practice in England (A doctor). This system does not apply in Scotland, Wales, or
Northern Ireland, where different rules are in place. Additionally, a referral must be
deemed clinically appropriate by a General Practitioner (GP). It is important to
understand that the decision to refer a patient is entirely the GP's responsibility. Once
this referral is agreed upon, the patient can exercise their Right to Choose to decide
which provider their referral is sent to.
Providers chosen under the Right to Choose system must meet specific requirements.
They must hold a commissioning contract with an NHS Clinical Commissioning Group
(CCG) or NHS England, and their services must be led by a consultant or qualified
mental healthcare professional. These conditions ensure that patients receive safe and
high-quality care. Care ADHD meets all these requirements.
There are some restrictions to the Right to Choose system. Patients who are already
receiving mental health care following an elective referral for the same condition cannot
use this system. Similarly, services commissioned by local authorities, such as drug
and alcohol services, are excluded unless they fall under a Section 75 agreement.
Urgent or crisis care, as well as services delivered through primary care contracts, are
not eligible for the Right to Choose.
Other exclusions apply to patients in secure settings, those detained under the Mental
Health Act 1983, and individuals in high-security psychiatric facilities. Members of the
armed forces are also excluded, although their family members residing in England
retain the same rights as other residents.
It is essential for both patients and GPs to understand that an Individual Funding
Request (IFR) is not required to use the Right to Choose system. Additionally, GPs do
not need approval from their Clinical Commissioning Group to proceed with a referral
under this framework. This makes the process straightforward and accessible for
eligible patients.
The Right to Choose explicitly includes ADHD assessments. If a GP determines that an
ADHD assessment is clinically appropriate, patients can request to be referred to an
approved provider such as Care ADHD. By choosing a provider like Care ADHD, patients 
can access expert assessments and care in a timely manner, supported by a team of
experienced professionals.
To take advantage of the Right to Choose for an ADHD assessment, patients can visit
our website to download the referral forms. After completing these forms, they can take
them to their GP and request a referral to Care ADHD. Once the GP agrees to the
referral, they will send it directly to us. This process ensures that patients can easily
access the high-quality ADHD care they need while exercising their Right to Choose.
The Right to Choose framework within the NHS is a key component of empowering
patients in England to take control of their healthcare decisions. This system allows
individuals to select where they receive NHS treatment, enabling better outcomes
through tailored care. Patients can make informed decisions about their options and are
encouraged to discuss preferences with their General Practitioner (GP) to ensure their
treatment aligns with their personal and medical needs.
Under this framework, if a GP determines that a referral is necessary for a physical or
mental health condition, patients generally have the legal right to choose the hospital or
service to which they are referred. This right extends to many private hospitals, provided
they offer services to the NHS at no additional cost compared to standard NHS
hospitals. Patients can also choose a clinical team led by a consultant or a named
healthcare professional, as long as they provide the required treatment.
Appointments can be scheduled through the NHS e-Referral service, either at the GP’s
office or online, using the shortlist provided in the appointment request letter. This
shortlist is created in consultation with the GP, and patients are encouraged to express
their preferences during the referral appointment. Together, the patient and GP can
compare information about hospitals or consultants, such as quality outcomes, waiting
times, and location convenience, to make an informed decision.
Patients also have a right to request a different provider if waiting times exceed the
maximum limits specified for their treatment. In such cases, the hospital or the
integrated care board (ICB) must investigate and offer a range of suitable alternatives
that can deliver care sooner. This ensures that patients are not left waiting excessively
for necessary treatments.
If a patient feels they have not been offered a choice at the point of referral, they should
raise this concern with the referring professional. Should the issue remain unresolved,
the patient can escalate their complaint to their local ICB, which is responsible for
ensuring patient choice is upheld. If the ICB does not provide a satisfactory resolution,
the patient may take their complaint to the independent Parliamentary and Health
Service Ombudsman.
Looking ahead, the NHS aims to expand patient choice further by integrating clearer
information about healthcare providers and waiting times into the NHS App. This will
enable patients to make more informed decisions and manage their care more
effectively. The goal is for all patients to feel they have explored their options thoroughly,
understood the pros and cons of each, and made decisions that align with their
preferences and circumstances.
At Care ADHD, we fully support patients exercising their Right to Choose, especially for
ADHD assessments. By visiting our website, you can download the necessary referral
forms. Simply take these forms to your GP, request a referral to Care ADHD, and your
doctor will send the referral directly to us. This straightforward process allows you to
access expert ADHD care while taking full advantage of your rights under this
framework.
The Right to Choose framework within the NHS is a vital mechanism that allows
patients in England to make informed decisions about their healthcare. It gives patients
the legal right to select where they receive NHS treatment, empowering them to access
care tailored to their specific needs. This right applies to both physical and mental
health conditions, including ADHD assessments, ensuring a broad application for
better patient outcomes.
For ADHD assessments specifically, Care ADHD supports the Right to Choose by
enabling patients to access our expert services. Patients can discuss their options with
their General Practitioner (GP), and if a referral is deemed clinically appropriate, they
can request to be referred to Care ADHD as their chosen provider. We make this
process straightforward and accessible, while maintaining the highest standards of
care.
Using the NHS e-Referral Service (e-RS) with Care ADHD
Care ADHD is fully integrated with the NHS e-Referral Service (e-RS), a national
system that allows referrals to be securely sent, tracked, and managed electronically.
Our service is fully compliant with NHS Digital standards, ensuring that we operate
within the framework set by the NHS to provide safe, efficient, and effective care.
Through e-RS, GPs can directly refer patients to Care ADHD by selecting our
organisation as the preferred provider during the referral process.
Secure Data Management through HSCN and EMIS
To ensure the highest level of security and seamless integration, Care ADHD operates
using EMIS, a leading clinical system widely trusted across the NHS. Our systems are
connected via the Health and Social Care Network (HSCN), which is the national,
secure network for the NHS and healthcare organisations. The HSCN provides a robust 
infrastructure for the secure exchange of information, ensuring that patient data is
always protected to the highest standards.
When your GP sends a referral to Care ADHD through e-RS, it is transmitted securely
through the HSCN, safeguarding your personal and medical information. The use of
EMIS further enhances this process by ensuring that your data is managed and
accessed only by authorised professionals involved in your care. This integration also
allows for efficient communication between healthcare providers, ensuring that your
journey from referral to treatment is as smooth as possible.
Benefits of Choosing Care ADHD through e-RS
By choosing Care ADHD, you can be confident that your referral and data are handled
with the utmost care and security. Our compliance with NHS Digital standards and use
of advanced systems like EMIS ensures that every aspect of your care is delivered
efficiently and securely. Through e-RS, GPs can easily refer you to us, track the status of
your referral, and collaborate with our team to provide a seamless experience.
How to Use Your Right to Choose with Care ADHD
If you are considering an ADHD assessment and wish to use the Right to Choose, simply
visit our website to download the necessary referral forms. Take these forms to your GP,
express your preference for Care ADHD, and your doctor will send the referral to us
electronically through e-RS. With the integration of EMIS and HSCN, you can rest
assured that your data remains confidential and secure at every step of the process.
Care ADHD is proud to offer a service that not only meets but exceeds the expectations
set by the NHS, combining cutting-edge technology with compassionate care to help
you access the treatment you deserve.
Our Process and pathway
Thank you for reaching out to Care ADHD. We greatly appreciate your interest in our
services and are pleased to provide you with detailed information about how we operate
and what you can expect from our processes. At Care ADHD, we are deeply committed
to delivering the highest quality of care, ensuring that every patient receives effective
and safe treatment tailored to their individual needs.
Care ADHD is fully registered with the Care Quality Commission (CQC), the
independent regulator of health and social care services in England. This registration
signifies our adherence to stringent quality and safety standards. Additionally, we follow
the clinical guidelines established by the National Institute for Health and Care
Excellence (NICE). By aligning our practices with these authoritative guidelines, we
ensure that the care we provide is both evidence-based and patient-focused.
A key figure in our organisation is Professor Tim Kendall, who serves as our Chairman.
Professor Kendall is a leading expert in the field of ADHD and mental health. Notably, he
chaired the national clinical guidelines for ADHD and served as the National Clinical
Director for Mental Health in England for eight years. Under his leadership, Care
ADHD’s clinical practices are informed by extensive expertise and a deep understanding
of the complexities of ADHD. His guidance ensures that we remain at the forefront of
ADHD care in the UK.
Once you have registered with Care ADHD, we will send you a set of questionnaires to
complete. These include the following:
DIVA Questionnaire (Diagnostic Interview for ADHD in Adults)
The DIVA questionnaire is a structured diagnostic tool designed specifically for assessing
ADHD in adults. It is based on the DSM-5 criteria for ADHD, focusing on two core areas:
inattention and hyperactivity/impulsivity. This questionnaire delves into how these symptoms
have affected you in both childhood and adulthood. By examining these patterns over time,
the DIVA helps our clinicians understand the persistence and impact of ADHD symptoms,
which is crucial for making a diagnosis.
Adult Informant Questionnaire: The Adult Informant Questionnaire is designed to
gather input from someone who knows you well, such as a family member, partner, or
close friend. This perspective provides invaluable insights into your behaviour and
symptoms from another person’s point of view, which can sometimes highlight aspects
of your ADHD that you may not fully recognise yourself. This external input helps to
validate self-reported symptoms and provides a more rounded understanding of how
ADHD affects your daily life.
Childhood Behavioural Rating Scale: ADHD is a neurodevelopmental condition,
meaning its symptoms typically begin in childhood. The Childhood Behavioural Rating
Scale helps assess behaviours and symptoms you may have experienced as a child,
which are often essential for confirming an ADHD diagnosis. This questionnaire relies
on retrospective accounts and, where possible, input from someone who knew you as a
child. It ensures that the diagnostic process aligns with the requirement that ADHD
symptoms must have been present before the age of 12.
GAD-7 (Generalised Anxiety Disorder Scale): The GAD-7 is a widely used tool to
measure the severity of anxiety symptoms. Since ADHD often coexists with anxiety
disorders, this questionnaire helps identify whether anxiety is a significant factor in your
mental health profile. By understanding the role anxiety may play, our clinicians can
differentiate between ADHD symptoms and those arising from anxiety or determine if a
combination of both is impacting your daily functioning.
PHQ-9 (Patient Health Questionnaire): The PHQ-9 is a validated tool for assessing the
severity of depressive symptoms. Depression is another common comorbidity in 
individuals with ADHD. This questionnaire helps us understand whether symptoms
such as low mood, fatigue, or difficulty concentrating are part of ADHD or linked to an
underlying depressive disorder. This differentiation is critical for developing an effective
treatment plan that addresses all aspects of your mental health.
Physical Health Questionnaire: ADHD can sometimes intersect with physical health
issues, either directly or due to lifestyle factors influenced by the condition. The
Physical Health Questionnaire gathers important information about your general health,
including any medical conditions, medications, or lifestyle factors that could influence
the diagnosis or treatment. It ensures that any proposed treatment plan is safe, taking
into account your overall health status.
WFIRS (Weiss Functional Impairment Rating Scale): The WFIRS assesses the impact
of ADHD symptoms on various aspects of daily life, including work, school, family
relationships, social interactions, and self-care. This tool goes beyond symptom
identification to evaluate how ADHD affects your functioning in real-world settings. It
helps us understand the practical challenges you face and guides the development of
interventions to improve your quality of life.
ASRS (Adult ADHD Self-Report Scale): The ASRS is a self-screening tool designed to
help identify the presence of ADHD symptoms in adults. It provides a quick but reliable
measure of the frequency and intensity of core ADHD symptoms, such as difficulty
concentrating, restlessness, or impulsive behaviour. The ASRS serves as a useful
starting point for understanding the extent to which ADHD symptoms are present and
their impact on your daily routine.Each of these questionnaires plays a critical role in
building a comprehensive understanding of your symptoms, behaviours, and overall
health. They allow us to tailor our assessment and recommendations specifically to
your needs.
Once you have completed and returned these questionnaires, we will schedule your
comprehensive assessment. It is important that you contact us via telephone or email
once the questionnaires are finished to ensure the next steps can proceed without
delay. The assessment itself is conducted online through Microsoft Teams, allowing
you to participate from the comfort of your own home. This virtual approach not only
provides convenience but also ensures accessibility, regardless of your location.
How These Questionnaires Work Together
Each of these questionnaires serves a unique purpose in building a comprehensive
picture of your experiences and challenges. When combined, they allow our clinicians
to:
Diagnose ADHD Accurately: By examining patterns of inattention, hyperactivity, and
impulsivity across different stages of life, supported by input from multiple
perspectives.
Identify Coexisting Conditions: Anxiety, depression, or other mental health conditions
often coexist with ADHD. Understanding these helps tailor the treatment plan.
Evaluate Functional Impairment: Understanding how ADHD symptoms impact your
life enables us to focus on areas needing the most support.
Ensure Safe and Effective Treatment: By factoring in your physical health and any
other conditions, we can provide recommendations that are both effective and safe.
We hope this information provides clarity and reassurance about the process at Care
ADHD. Should you have any further questions or require additional details, please do
not hesitate to get in touch. We are here to support you every step of the way.
Waiting times
Accessing an ADHD assessment in the UK can be challenging due to long waiting times,
particularly within the NHS. For adults seeking an ADHD diagnosis, it is not uncommon
to face waits exceeding 18 months or even longer in some areas. The increasing
demand for ADHD services, combined with limited capacity in many NHS trusts, has
contributed to these extensive delays. For many individuals, these wait times can lead
to prolonged struggles with symptoms that affect their quality of life, relationships, and
ability to work.
In the private sector, waiting times can vary significantly. Some providers offer quicker
access to initial consultations, but these may still involve delays in progressing through
the assessment and treatment stages due to limited availability of clinicians or high
demand. This inconsistency in private services has left many individuals unsure where
to turn for timely and reliable care.
At Care ADHD, we are committed to minimising waiting times while maintaining the
highest quality of service. To achieve this, we leverage the latest technology and
advanced demand and capacity modelling. By analysing trends in demand and
optimising our resources, we ensure that our processes are both efficient and scalable.
This allows us to respond rapidly to new referrals and maintain consistently short
waiting times, even as demand grows.
One of the key ways we keep our waiting times short is by empowering patients to
control the pace of their journey. After registering with us, patients receive a series of
questionnaires that are essential for their assessment. These questionnaires are
comprehensive and designed to gather critical information about their symptoms,
behaviours, and overall health. Importantly, the speed at which an individual can be
seen is determined by how quickly they complete and return these questionnaires.
As soon as the completed questionnaires are received, we can schedule the
assessment within one to two weeks (working days). This patient-driven approach
ensures that individuals who are ready to proceed can access care without
unnecessary delays. For those who need more time to complete the forms, the process
remains flexible, allowing them to move forward at their own pace.
Our assessments are conducted online via Microsoft Teams, providing both
convenience and accessibility. This virtual approach not only eliminates the need for
travel but also allows us to extend our services to individuals across the UK. By
combining technology, streamlined processes, and a patient-centred approach, we can
offer a significantly faster pathway to diagnosis and treatment compared to many other
providers.
Care ADHD is proud to set a new standard in ADHD care by prioritising timely access
and patient empowerment. We understand how important it is for individuals to receive
the support they need without unnecessary delays, and our commitment to innovation
and efficiency ensures that we can deliver on this promise. If you're considering an
ADHD assessment, you can rest assured that Care ADHD is dedicated to providing fast,
effective, and compassionate care.
Booking an appointment slot: Once you have completed your questionnaires, it is
crucial that you contact us to inform us that they are ready for review. While we do our
best to monitor profiles regularly, contacting us directly will ensure that your
appointment is booked much faster.
You can reach out to us either via telephone or email, and our team will prioritise
scheduling your assessment. Taking this step allows us to streamline the process and
secure an available appointment slot promptly. By notifying us as soon as your
questionnaires are complete, you can move forward in your care journey without
unnecessary delays.
We are here to support you at every stage and will work with you to ensure a smooth and
efficient booking process. Your prompt communication helps us provide you with the
fastest possible access to our services.
Can I Get Medication if I Have Been Diagnosed Elsewhere?
As a private paying client, yes, we are happy to help you if you have been diagnosed with
ADHD by another service. To begin the process, we require a couple of documents to
ensure that we can provide safe and effective treatment. We need a copy of your ADHD
report confirming your diagnosis, as this allows us to verify that your assessment was
carried out by a qualified and regulated clinician, meeting all necessary regulatory
expectations. Additionally, we require a copy of your Summary Care Record (SCR), 
which you can obtain from your GP or, in some cases, through the NHS app. When
speaking with your GP, you can request that they send your SCR directly to us at
Enquiries@careadhd.co.uk. If your GP requires us to contact them first, simply provide
us with your GP practice's email address, and we will reach out on your behalf.
The SCR is essential because ADHD treatment often involves prescribing stimulant or
non-stimulant medications, and we need to ensure that these medications are safe for
you. This includes verifying any medical contraindications, allergies, or current
medications that could impact your treatment. Once we receive your ADHD report and
SCR, we will send you a physical health questionnaire to complete. This helps us build a
comprehensive understanding of your health to guide your treatment plan.
If you are an NHS patient, we recommend that you discuss this with your GP first. If your
GP is happy, we will contact your Integrated Care Board (ICB) to ensure they are willing
to cover the titration costs. This step ensures that all parties involved are aligned and
that the process is handled correctly.
Once we have received all the required information—the ADHD report, SCR, and
completed physical health questionnaire—we can begin your titration process. This is
where we work with you to identify the most effective medication and dosage to meet
your needs.
The cost of our titration service is £499 for three clinics. Medication costs are set by the
pharmacy and can vary depending on the type and dosage. Typically, these costs range
between £50 and £130 per prescription, including dispensing and delivery to your
doorstep.
If you have any questions or need assistance obtaining the necessary documents,
please do not hesitate to contact us.

Why Is the Childhood Behavioural Questionnaire Important?
The Childhood Behavioural Questionnaire is a vital component of the assessment
process for diagnosing ADHD. It helps gather essential information about behavioural
patterns during childhood, which is crucial for meeting the diagnostic criteria outlined
in the DSM-5 (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition).
The DSM-5 specifies that for a diagnosis of ADHD, symptoms must have been present
before the age of 12. This requirement ensures that the condition is accurately identified
as a neurodevelopmental disorder and not mistaken for challenges arising later in life
due to other factors.
By collecting retrospective accounts of childhood behaviours, the questionnaire allows
clinicians to evaluate symptoms such as inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity as
they were observed in various settings, including home, school, and social
environments. This comprehensive perspective ensures that symptoms are not
environment-specific and helps confirm that they persist across multiple contexts, a
critical element of the DSM-5 diagnostic framework. The questionnaire also helps rule 
out other potential causes for the symptoms, such as anxiety or learning disabilities,
ensuring a thorough and accurate diagnosis.
In cases where individuals may not have access to those who knew them before the age
of 12, tools like the Wender Utah Rating Scale provide an alternative means of
obtaining valuable information about childhood behaviours. The Wender Utah scale
allows adults to self-report their recollections of early-life behaviours and symptoms,
offering a structured way to reflect on past experiences even in the absence of direct
informants such as parents, caregivers, or teachers. This approach ensures that
individuals are not excluded from receiving a diagnosis due to gaps in their personal
history or limited access to childhood observers.
Using the Childhood Behavioural Questionnaire or the Wender Utah Rating Scale helps
clinicians establish whether the individual’s symptoms meet the DSM-5 criteria,
including the presence of at least six symptoms of inattention and/or hyperactivityimpulsivity during childhood. These tools also help identify the persistence and severity
of symptoms over time, providing a robust foundation for understanding the individual’s
developmental history.
Ultimately, the Childhood Behavioural Questionnaire, complemented by tools like the
Wender Utah scale, ensures a thorough and validated diagnostic process. By capturing
the nuances of early behavioural patterns, clinicians can provide a diagnosis that is
both accurate and reflective of the individual’s lifelong experiences with ADHD.
Why Is the Adult Informant Questionnaire Important?
The Adult Informant Questionnaire is an essential part of the ADHD assessment
process, providing critical insights from a trusted individual who knows the person well
in their current life. This tool supports the diagnostic process by helping clinicians
evaluate whether the individual meets the criteria outlined in the DSM-5 (Diagnostic
and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition) for ADHD.
The DSM-5 emphasises that ADHD symptoms must cause clinically significant
impairment in at least two settings, such as work, home, or social environments. The
Adult Informant Questionnaire enables clinicians to gather observations from someone
who interacts with the individual regularly, offering an objective perspective on how
symptoms such as inattention, hyperactivity, or impulsivity manifest in everyday
situations. These insights are especially valuable in confirming the pervasiveness and
severity of symptoms, which is critical for meeting diagnostic requirements.
This questionnaire ensures that the diagnosis is not solely based on self-reports, which
can sometimes be influenced by subjective bias or limited self-awareness. The
informant's perspective provides a more rounded and accurate picture of the 
individual’s behaviour and its impact on their functioning, particularly in areas such as
maintaining relationships, completing tasks, or managing responsibilities.
For individuals who may struggle to identify someone who knows them well enough to
complete the Adult Informant Questionnaire, other tools or methods can be utilised to
gather the necessary evidence. Structured interviews with colleagues, partners, or
friends who have observed the individual’s behaviour can supplement the assessment.
This flexibility ensures that the absence of a single informant does not create barriers to
diagnosis.
The Adult Informant Questionnaire also plays a critical role in distinguishing ADHD
symptoms from behaviours that might arise due to other factors such as stress, anxiety,
or external pressures. By obtaining a third-party perspective, clinicians can better
understand whether the symptoms reflect a consistent pattern of impairment linked to
ADHD or are situationally driven.
Incorporating the Adult Informant Questionnaire into the assessment process ensures
that clinicians have a well-rounded and robust set of data to determine whether the
individual’s symptoms meet the DSM-5 criteria for ADHD. This tool enhances the
diagnostic process, providing a more accurate and comprehensive understanding of
how ADHD affects the individual in their current life.
Do I Have to Have Treatment with You?
No, not at all. Whether you come to us through the NHS or as a private client, you are
under no obligation to stay and have treatment with us. We believe that your healthcare
decisions should be entirely your choice, and we fully respect your autonomy.
At Care ADHD, we are proud to offer one of the most affordable clinics in England, and
we strive to provide high-quality care that meets your needs. However, we understand
that everyone’s journey is different. You will never be pressured to remain with us, and if
you choose to leave our clinic after your diagnosis, we will thank you for allowing us to
be part of your journey and genuinely wish you well in the next steps you take.
Your wellbeing and comfort in choosing the right care provider for you will always be our
priority.
Will I Receive Confirmation of My Diagnosis?
Yes, as part of our pathway, you will automatically receive a formal letter confirming
your ADHD diagnosis. This letter will state that you have attended an assessment and
that you meet the threshold for a formal diagnosis under the DSM-5 (Diagnostic and
Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition) criteria.
This document is designed to be shared with your workplace or educational institution,
providing them with the necessary confirmation to support any adjustments or 
accommodations you may need. It reflects the professional and thorough nature of your
assessment and serves as a valuable tool in helping you access the support you are
entitled to.
If you have any specific requirements for the letter, please let us know, and we will do
our best to assist.
Why Do I Need to Provide ID Before My Assessment?
Providing identification before your ADHD assessment is a crucial step that ensures the
integrity, security, and accuracy of the diagnostic process. First and foremost, verifying
your identity allows us to confirm that the assessment is being conducted for the
correct individual. This is particularly vital in healthcare, where accurate records and
correspondence are essential to delivering safe and effective care tailored to each
person’s unique needs.
Another important reason is regulatory compliance. As a healthcare clinic, we operate
within strict guidelines designed to maintain transparency and accountability. Verifying
the identity of every client is a fundamental requirement to uphold these standards. It
also ensures that we are meeting our responsibilities to protect your confidentiality and
safeguard your personal information. By confirming your identity, we can ensure that
your private health records remain secure and are shared only with you or those you
authorise, adding an extra layer of protection for your sensitive data.
Requiring ID also helps prevent misuse of our services. This precaution eliminates the
risk of fraudulent assessments or impersonation, which could compromise the
accuracy of medical records and the integrity of our clinic. In addition, providing your ID
ensures that all official documentation, including your diagnostic letter, is issued
accurately in your name. This is particularly important if you need to share your
diagnosis with a workplace or educational institution to access adjustments or
accommodations.
Overall, providing ID is a simple but vital step that allows us to maintain the highest
standards of care and security for all our clients. If you have any questions or concerns
about this process, we are here to guide and support you every step of the way.
Missed Appointment Policy
We understand that sometimes circumstances beyond your control can arise, and we
empathise with the challenges that might lead to a missed appointment. However, each
appointment requires considerable preparation by our clinical and administrative
teams, including time specifically allocated by a senior clinician. Missed appointments
not only incur costs but also mean that someone else waiting for an assessment or
treatment may have missed an opportunity to be seen.
To cover the costs incurred and ensure we can continue to provide affordable services,
we have implemented a rebooking fee of £150. This fee is outlined in our Terms and
Conditions and in the FAQs section on our website. It is significantly lower than the
actual cost of the missed appointment itself and allows us to maintain our commitment
to keeping Care ADHD as one of the most cost-effective options for ADHD assessments
and treatments across the UK.
Previously, we did not charge for rebookings, but as we strive to offer affordable pricing
to all, our margins do not allow for absorbing the costs of missed appointments.
Reluctantly, we have introduced this policy to ensure the sustainability of our services
and to continue providing quality care to everyone who needs it.
If you would like to reschedule your appointment, please complete the payment using
the following link: Payment Link. Once your payment is processed, please contact us at
enquiries@careadhd.co.uk, and we will assist you in booking a new time that works for
you.
Thank you for your understanding, and we remain committed to supporting you on your
ADHD journey. If you have any questions or concerns about this policy, please don’t
hesitate to reach out.
Will This Diagnosis Be Officially Recognised?
Yes, your diagnosis will be officially recognised. As a CQC-registered organisation,
Care ADHD is fully authorised to assess and treat conditions such as ADHD. This means
any diagnosis made by our clinical team is formally recognised and meets the
standards required in the UK.
When people ask whether the NHS or their GP will recognise the diagnosis or if it is
transferable, they are typically referring to the concept of shared care. Shared care
occurs when your GP agrees to continue prescribing your ADHD medications on the
NHS after your initial titration period, which can often be more cost-effective than
continuing to purchase medications privately.
It’s important to note that GPs usually do not have the specific expertise required to
initiate ADHD medications. This is where our experienced prescribing team comes in. If
you decide to start ADHD medications (a process called titration), our team will first
assess whether it is safe for you to begin treatment. They will then prescribe, monitor,
and adjust your medications over a 12-week period to ensure you are on the right type
and dose for your needs. During this time, you will purchase your medications from a
private pharmacy. We collaborate closely with these pharmacies, though they operate
independently from Care ADHD.
After the titration period, many GPs are willing to take over prescribing through shared
care arrangements, meaning you can receive your medications on the NHS. However, 
while most GPs are open to shared care, some may not wish to participate. We
recommend discussing this with your GP before beginning treatment, as their
agreement will make the transition smoother. If your GP is happy to proceed with shared
care, we are too, and we will work closely with them to support this process.
It’s also worth mentioning that Care ADHD now holds several NHS contracts to provide
ADHD assessment and treatment services. This reflects our commitment to delivering
high-quality care and ensures that individuals seeking support through the NHS can
access our expertise.
If you have further questions about your diagnosis, shared care, or our NHS
partnerships, please don’t hesitate to reach out to our team. We are here to guide and
support you every step of the way.
Payment Options and Cost Flexibility
At Care ADHD, we aim to make accessing high-quality ADHD assessment and
treatment as straightforward and affordable as possible. For private clients, we are
pleased to offer payment plans through our partnerships with Clearpay and Klarna,
giving you greater flexibility to manage your payments.
Clearpay and Klarna are widely trusted payment platforms that allow you to spread the
cost of your treatment over manageable instalments. With Clearpay, you can split your
payment into four equal amounts, paid every two weeks without any interest. Klarna
offers additional options, including splitting payments over several months or paying in
full after a set period, depending on what suits your financial needs best. These
platforms provide transparency and ease, ensuring you can prioritise your care without
immediate financial strain.
For those coming through the Right to Choose pathway, your treatment is fully funded
under the NHS. This means there are no costs for your assessment or titration process.
The only expense you will need to cover is the cost of your medication, which will be
charged at the NHS tariff of approximately £9.50 per prescription. If you prefer to
have your medication delivered to your door, there may be additional delivery costs
charged by the pharmacy, but these are optional based on your convenience.
We are committed to supporting you in accessing the care you need, whether privately
or through the NHS. If you have any questions about payment options or the Right to
Choose pathway, our team is here to help and guide you through the process.

£299 and includes a thorough evaluation to determine whether you meet the criteria for
a formal ADHD diagnosis.
Following a diagnosis, if you choose to begin medication, our Post-Diagnostic

ADHD Pricing. If you have any further questions, don’t hesitate to get in touch. We’re
here to support you at every step.
What Is a Summary Care Record?
A Summary Care Record (SCR) is a concise, electronic summary of your key health
information, maintained by the NHS. Its primary purpose is to ensure that healthcare
professionals have access to essential details about your medical history when treating
you, particularly in situations where your GP records may not be immediately
accessible.
The SCR typically includes critical information such as your current medications, known
allergies, and any adverse reactions you have experienced to specific medications. This
ensures that any medical treatment you receive, whether from your GP, in a hospital, or
at another healthcare setting, is safe and informed by accurate information.
In the context of ADHD treatment, the SCR is particularly important because it helps
clinicians determine whether it is safe to prescribe ADHD medications, which can
interact with other medications or underlying health conditions. Having access to this
information allows us to tailor your care to your specific needs, ensuring that the
treatment is effective and without unnecessary risks.
You can request a copy of your SCR from your GP or access it via the NHS app if your GP
practice is connected to the app. If your GP practice prefers to send it directly to us, we 
are happy to provide assistance in facilitating this process. The SCR plays a vital role in
delivering safe, personalised care and is a key component of the ADHD assessment and
treatment pathway.
Why Are You Cheaper?
We prefer to say 'more affordable'—it has a much nicer ring to it, don’t you think? Our
CEO and Founder, who was previously a Director in the NHS, has a bit of a story behind
this. As part of his role running Mental Health Services in Suffolk and later South East
London, he was responsible for commissioning private providers to help reduce waiting
lists. When he started looking into the costs charged by some of these providers for
ADHD assessments, he was genuinely shocked at how high they were.
Let’s put it simply: we believe that by keeping our prices lower, we can help more people
who really need support. We don’t believe in charging margins of £800+ profit per
assessment, which many providers do. Instead, we set our prices to cover the
considerable costs of running a regulated, high-quality clinic—things like our CQC
registration, clinical training, and operational expenses. Of course, we aim to make a
small profit to ensure we can keep growing and meeting the incredible demand, but
accessibility and fairness are at the heart of what we do.
When you book with us, you’ll still receive the same formal diagnosis and care pathway
as you would through the NHS or even a premium clinic on Harley Street. In fact, we’re
very confident that our clinical standards and training match the highest levels you’ll
find anywhere in the UK, whether that’s in the private sector or the NHS.
I hope this clears things up! If you’ve got any other questions or need more information,
don’t hesitate to ask—we’re here to help.
Will I Be Assessed by Someone on the GMC Register?
Thank you for your question. At Care ADHD, we adhere strictly to NICE guidelines,
which specify that ADHD assessments and diagnoses can be conducted by
appropriately qualified healthcare clinicians. While our Chairman and Medical Director
are both registered with the General Medical Council (GMC), the clinician conducting
your assessment may be registered with a different professional body, such as the
Nursing and Midwifery Council (NMC) or another relevant register.
All our clinicians are highly trained and experienced in ADHD assessment and
diagnosis, ensuring that you receive the highest standard of care. Regardless of their
specific register, every clinician working with us meets the regulatory and professional
requirements necessary to provide safe, effective, and evidence-based ADHD care.
If you have further questions about our team or their qualifications, please don’t
hesitate to get in touch—we’re happy to provide any additional information you need!
Will My GP Titrate Me?
In short, probably not. Most GPs prefer that individuals are titrated by a specialist, as
this process requires ongoing monitoring, adjustments, and support to ensure the
medication is safe and effective. That said, it’s always worth asking your GP—although
I’ve yet to come across a GP who will undertake titration for ADHD, there’s always a first
time!
While there’s absolutely no pressure from us to choose our titration service, we pride
ourselves on offering a quick, safe, and more affordable option than most providers. If
you’d like to explore this further or discuss the options available, please don’t hesitate
to let us know. We’re here to help you navigate your ADHD journey with confidence.
I Have Made a Payment for Medication—When Will I Get an Appointment?
Thank you for making your payment. If you’ve also submitted all the required
documents—your Summary Care Record (SCR), Physical Health Questionnaire, and
ADHD report—our Clinical Care Hub is now reviewing your information.
This review is a crucial step in ensuring it is safe for you to begin ADHD medication. Our
team will carefully assess your physical health details to identify any potential risks or
contraindications. For example, ADHD medication may not be safe to start if you have
certain heart conditions, high blood pressure, untreated thyroid issues, or other medical
factors that could increase the risk of adverse effects. Additionally, if you’re taking other
medications, we need to ensure there are no harmful interactions.
Once the Clinical Care Hub has completed this assessment and confirmed that it is
safe to proceed, we will schedule your first titration appointment. Our priority is to keep
you safe while providing a tailored approach to finding the right medication and dosage
for your needs.
If you have any further questions or if you’re unsure whether all your documents have
been submitted, please don’t hesitate to get in touch. We’re here to help and guide you
every step of the way.
If you like I can send my colleagues in the Clinical Care Hub an email for an update and
someone will be in touch with you? (IF the patient says yes, then get Jessica to email or
message in slack)
How long it takes to get an appointment/how long waiting times are? (These times
may change)
Thank for the question, the length of time it takes to get an appointment is down to the
individual completing the questionnaires that we send out. Once we are notified that all
the questionnaires have been completed then our booking team will reach out to get
you booked in for your assessment. Currently from the point of getting your
questionnaires back to you sitting in front of a trusted assessing clinician is less than 3
weeks.
What is the process
We offer two routes to access our services. The first is as a private paying client. To
begin, you can visit our website and register for a one-time fee of £299. Once you have
made the payment, you will receive the necessary questionnaires to complete and
return. After you have submitted the completed questionnaires, we will schedule your
comprehensive assessment. This assessment is conducted online via Microsoft Teams,
allowing you to attend from the comfort of your own home. During the assessment, the
clinician will determine whether you meet the threshold for a formal ADHD diagnosis. If
you are diagnosed, you will have the option to begin treatment with us or be discharged
from our clinic.
The second route is through the NHS-funded Right to Choose pathway. To access this
option, you will need to visit our website at www.careadhd.co.uk and click on the "Right
to Choose" tab to learn more about the process. You will then need to approach your GP
and request a referral to our clinic under the Right to Choose programme. Once we
receive the referral from your GP, we will send you login details for your personalised
portal, where your questionnaires will be ready to complete. After you have completed
the questionnaires, our team will contact you to arrange your assessment. The
assessment process is the same as for private clients and is conducted online via
Microsoft Teams.
How do I get on the RTC pathway
To come to us through right to choose simple visit your GP and ask to be referred to Care
ADHD under your right to choose for an ADHD assessment. You can visit our website or
visit our friends at ADHD uk to find out more about right to choose.
Where do your assessments take place
Currently all our assessments take place on line so you can have your assessment in
the comfort of your own home.
I have no one to fill in the Adult informant or Childhood Behaviour forms 
If you are unable to have someone fill in the Adult Informant or Childhood Behaviour
forms on your behalf, it is important to let us know as soon as possible. While these
forms are helpful in building a comprehensive picture of your symptoms and history, we
understand that not everyone has someone available to provide this information.
If you are unable to provide these forms, it does not necessarily prevent you from
receiving an assessment but it does make it harder to provide a positive diagnosis. Our
clinicians are trained to work with the information you can provide and will use
alternative methods during your assessment to explore your ADHD symptoms and
history such as the Wedner Utah. This might involve asking more detailed questions
about your experiences in childhood and adulthood to gather the necessary
information.
why do i need a summary care record
A Summary Care Record (SCR) is important in the ADHD assessment and treatment
process because it provides essential medical information that helps ensure your care
is safe and appropriate. The SCR is a digital record maintained by your GP that includes
crucial details such as your current medications, any known allergies, and any adverse
reactions to medications. This information allows our clinicians to confirm that any
prescribed treatment will not interact with medications you are already taking or worsen
any pre-existing conditions. It also helps verify your medical history, ensuring the
information used to inform your diagnosis and treatment plan is accurate and reliable.
Additionally, the SCR facilitates communication and continuity of care between our
clinic and your GP, ensuring everyone involved in your care has the necessary
information.
If you are referred to us under the Right to Choose pathway, your GP will automatically
include your SCR as part of the referral process, so there is nothing further you need to
do. However, if you are accessing our services privately, you will need to provide your
SCR to ensure we have the information needed to proceed with your care. If you
encounter any difficulties accessing your SCR, please contact us, and we will assist you
with the process.
I paid for my assessment but haven't had any questionnaires
(Ask Jessica to get the first and second name of the patient and their date of birth,
Jessica will then tell the patient that she will email the team and someone will look into
this for the patient – Jessica then needs to email the patient a copy of the conversation)
Are you a real company
Yes we are, we were registered by Mark Pattison on the 22nd December 2022.
When will I receive my report
We aim to get your report out to you within five working days following your assessment
Do you send my report to my GP
Yes, we are required to send your report to your GP, even if you would prefer not to have
it added to your records. This is because your GP plays a central role in coordinating
your overall healthcare. By sharing the report, we ensure that your GP has a full
understanding of your diagnosis and any treatment plan that may be initiated,
particularly if it involves prescribing medication or managing potential interactions with
other treatments you may receive in the future.
Your GP’s involvement is essential for ensuring your safety and continuity of care. For
example, if you are prescribed ADHD medication, your GP needs to be aware to prevent
any harmful interactions with other medications or treatments they may prescribe later.
Additionally, your medical records provide a long-term record that may be important for
your care in other settings, such as hospital treatments or consultations with other
specialists.
While we understand that some people may have concerns about privacy, it’s important
to prioritise safe and effective healthcare. If you have specific concerns, please let us
know, and we can discuss your options further.
