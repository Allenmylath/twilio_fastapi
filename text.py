text= ''' Below are answers strictly based on the information available in the Care ADHD knowledge
base. If something isn’t covered by the knowledge base, I’ll let you know that the information is
not available.
1. What is ADHD, and how is it diagnosed?
ADHD is described in our knowledge base as a neurodevelopmental condition usually present
from childhood. At Care ADHD, we follow NICE guidelines (the National Institute for Health
and Care Excellence) and assess ADHD using structured diagnostic tools—like the DIVA
questionnaire, along with other forms and interviews. Our clinicians look for patterns of
inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity, confirmed to have started before age 12, which aligns
with the DSM-5 criteria. While we can provide general information, for personalised medical
advice, please consult a qualified professional.
2. What are the common symptoms of ADHD in adults and children?
Our knowledge base notes that ADHD symptoms include inattention (like difficulty focusing and
disorganisation), hyperactivity (restlessness), and impulsivity (acting quickly without thinking).
However, we focus on adults aged 18 and over. In adults, challenges often show up as difficulty
concentrating, restlessness, or problems with organisation. Children typically have similar core
symptoms, but we primarily assess adults, so for any specifics regarding children’s symptoms,
we suggest speaking with a qualified healthcare provider.
Additional information:
ADHD symptoms in both children and adults vary but generally fall into two categories:
inattentive and hyperactive-impulsive behaviours.
In children, inattentive symptoms include difficulty sustaining attention, making careless
mistakes, and appearing not to listen when spoken to directly. They may often lose items
needed for tasks, become easily distracted, and struggle to follow through on instructions
or complete activities. Hyperactive-impulsive symptoms in children can include fidgeting,
leaving their seat when it’s inappropriate, running or climbing in unsuitable situations,
talking excessively, blurting out answers, and interrupting others.
In adults, inattentive symptoms often present as missed deadlines, forgetfulness, poor
organisation, and challenges with time management. Adults with ADHD may find it hard to
focus on tasks requiring sustained effort, often misplace items, and frequently daydream or
become distracted. Hyperactive-impulsive symptoms in adults can appear as restlessness,
difficulty sitting still, impulsive decision-making, interrupting conversations, and excessive
talking. Adults may also struggle with emotional regulation, leading to frustration or
outbursts.While some symptoms, such as impulsivity and distractibility, are common across all ages,
they may manifest differently depending on life responsibilities and expectations. Let me
know if you'd like to delve deeper into how these symptoms impact daily life or discuss
potential management strategies.

3. Can ADHD be misdiagnosed?
The knowledge base doesn’t provide specific details on misdiagnosis. However, it does highlight
that the diagnostic process at Care ADHD is thorough and follows NICE guidelines, aiming to
reduce the likelihood of misdiagnosis. If you have concerns about misdiagnosis, the best step is
to speak with a clinician for further clarification.
Correct answer:
Yes, ADHD can be misdiagnosed, often due to overlapping symptoms with other conditions,
insufficient evaluation, or biases in recognising it within certain groups. Many conditions, such
as anxiety, depression, autism spectrum disorder (ASD), sleep disorders, and learning
difficulties, share symptoms like inattention, hyperactivity, or restlessness, making accurate
diagnosis challenging.
Environmental factors, such as stress, trauma, or an unsupportive school or work environment,
can also mimic ADHD symptoms. Additionally, age can play a role; in children, natural
developmental behaviours may be mistaken for ADHD, while in adults, the condition is
sometimes misdiagnosed as anxiety or personality disorders.
Gender bias further complicates diagnosis, as boys are more likely to be identified due to overt
hyperactive symptoms, while girls with inattentive ADHD are often overlooked or misdiagnosed
with anxiety or depression. Overdiagnosis is another concern, particularly when behaviours like
fidgeting or distractibility are generalised or when there’s pressure to explain underperformance
in school or work.
A rushed or incomplete diagnostic process increases the likelihood of misdiagnosis. Accurate
diagnosis requires a detailed evaluation, including a comprehensive history of symptoms across
different settings, input from family or colleagues, and thorough screening for other conditions.
Here at Care ADHD, our staff are trained to a high standard and are required to shadow a number
of clinics before leading their own. This ensures our team is fully equipped to meet the needs of
our patients. Additionally, we run regular clinical audits against the DSM-5 criteria to ensure our
diagnoses are accurate and evidence-based. By maintaining these high standards, we strive to
deliver the most reliable and supportive care possible. Let me know if you'd like to explore how
we manage ADHD or discuss our processes further.

4. How does ADHD affect daily life, relationships, and work?
From our knowledge base, ADHD can affect multiple areas of someone’s life, such as
maintaining focus at work, staying organised at home, and maintaining relationships. Care
ADHD uses questionnaires like the WFIRS (Weiss Functional Impairment Rating Scale) to
understand how symptoms may impact daily functioning. If you’d like more personalised
insights, a full assessment is recommended.
Additional information
ADHD can significantly affect daily life, relationships, and work, often creating unique
challenges. In daily life, individuals may struggle with time management, disorganisation, and
poor focus, leading to missed deadlines, lost items, and unfinished tasks. Impulsivity can result
in risky behaviours or poor decision-making, while difficulties with emotional regulation can
cause frustration and stress.
In relationships, ADHD may cause communication struggles, such as interrupting others or
difficulty staying present in conversations. Forgetfulness can lead to missed commitments, and
impulsivity or emotional reactivity may strain interactions. However, many individuals with
ADHD bring energy, creativity, and spontaneity to their relationships, which can be positive
traits when managed well.
At work, ADHD can make it challenging to focus, prioritise tasks, and meet deadlines.
Procrastination and disorganisation may result in feeling overwhelmed, while impulsivity can
lead to hasty decisions. Despite these challenges, individuals with ADHD often excel in creative
thinking, generate innovative ideas, and can hyperfocus on tasks they find engaging. Their high
energy can also thrive in dynamic environments.
Support and strategies can help reduce the impact of ADHD in these areas. Structured routines,
reminders, open communication, and workplace accommodations can improve daily functioning.
Professional support, such as therapy or coaching, can also help individuals develop effective
coping skills. Let me know if you'd like to explore specific strategies or how Care ADHD can
support these needs.

5. Is ADHD hereditary or influenced by environmental factors?
Our knowledge base does not provide details on specific causes of ADHD, such as heredity or
environmental factors. This information is not in our database.
Additional information
ADHD is influenced by both genetic and environmental factors. Research shows that genetics
play a significant role, as ADHD often runs in families. Children are more likely to develop the
condition if a parent or close relative has it, and specific genes involved in dopamine regulation
have been linked to ADHD. However, genetics alone do not fully explain its development.
Environmental factors also contribute to ADHD. Prenatal risks, such as exposure to smoking,
alcohol, or drugs during pregnancy, as well as low birth weight or premature birth, can increasethe likelihood of ADHD. Early childhood experiences, including high levels of stress, trauma, or
neglect, may exacerbate symptoms. Exposure to environmental toxins, such as lead, has also
been associated with attention and behavioural issues. Additionally, while diet and lifestyle do
not directly cause ADHD, certain dietary patterns or deficiencies may influence its symptoms.
The development of ADHD is thought to result from a complex interaction between genetic
predisposition and environmental influences. For example, a child with a genetic tendency
toward ADHD may only develop the condition when exposed to specific environmental risks.
Let me know if you’d like to explore how these factors are managed or supported at Care
ADHD.

6. What happens during an ADHD assessment at Care ADHD?
When you register with Care ADHD, we send out questionnaires—like the DIVA for core ADHD
symptoms, the PHQ-9 for depressive symptoms, GAD-7 for anxiety, plus others. Once you
complete them, we arrange an online video call via Microsoft Teams with a trained clinician who
reviews your history, symptoms, and overall health. They determine whether you meet the
threshold for a formal ADHD diagnosis using DSM-5 criteria, aligned with NICE guidelines.
During an ADHD assessment at Care ADHD, you will meet one of our highly trained clinicians
through our online platform. Upon accessing the assessment link, your clinician will warmly
welcome you and explain the process.
Before your assessment, your clinician will have thoroughly reviewed the answers you provided
in your pre-assessment questionnaires. This ensures that the assessment is tailored to your
specific needs. The structure of the interview will depend on the answers you have given,
allowing the clinician to focus on the most relevant areas.
The clinician will then conduct a structured interview based on the DSM-5 ADHD criteria. This
method ensures a thorough and evidence-based evaluation to determine whether you meet the
criteria for an ADHD diagnosis. Our aim is to make the process as comfortable and
comprehensive as possible. Let me know if you'd like more details or support with this process.

7. How long does it take to get an ADHD diagnosis?
According to our knowledge base, the speed depends on how quickly you return your
questionnaires. After you let us know they’re completed, we typically book your assessment
within about three weeks. The actual diagnostic decision is usually made during or shortly after
that online appointment, provided all relevant information is available.

8. What is the cost of an ADHD assessment at Care ADHD?
Our knowledge base states that the Private Clinical Diagnostic Assessment is £299. This fee
covers the evaluation to determine whether you meet the threshold for an ADHD diagnosis.
Additional information
To get referred to Care ADHD through the Right to Choose pathway, start by booking an
appointment with your GP. During the appointment, discuss your concerns about ADHD and
mention that you would like to use the Right to Choose option for your assessment and
treatment. Let your GP know that Care ADHD is on the Right to Choose list and operates
remotely to provide specialist ADHD services.
Once your referral is processed, Care ADHD will contact you with the next steps. This will
include completing pre-assessment forms and scheduling your online appointment with one of
their trained clinicians. Be sure to complete the forms promptly and provide accurate information
to ensure a smooth process.
If your GP is unfamiliar with the Right to Choose pathway, you can explain that it is an NHS
initiative that allows patients to choose their preferred provider for certain services, including
ADHD assessments. Let me know if you need help preparing for your GP appointment or further
information about the process. By coming to Care ADHD through right to means that Care
ADHD will invoice your local ICB (Integrate Care Board), rather than you having to pay for the
assessment.

9. Do I need a referral from my GP to get assessed?
You have two options:
• Private route: No GP referral needed. You can self-refer by registering directly on our
website and paying the £299 fee.
• Right to Choose route (RTC): You do need a GP referral under the NHS Right to
Choose framework. Your GP sends the referral to us, and we carry out the assessment
funded by the NHS.

10. Can children and teenagers be assessed at Care ADHD?
The knowledge base specifically states that Care ADHD is a UK-based organisation dedicated to
assessing, diagnosing, and treating adults aged 18 and over. Therefore, we do not offer
assessments for individuals under 18.Our CQC registration currently means our service is for 18 and older. We have plans to start
assessing and treating children later in the summer of 2025 please keep an eye out on our website
for more information.

11. What treatment options are available for ADHD?
According to our knowledge base, we develop personalised treatment plans after diagnosis.
These may include medication management (e.g., low-dose stimulant or non-stimulant
medication) and psychological interventions, such as CBT-informed modules or coaching
through our Care ADHD app.

12. Do you prescribe ADHD medication, and how does it work?
Yes. For our private patients, once you’ve been diagnosed and decide to start treatment, we can
prescribe ADHD medications. We also offer titration and monitoring over a 12-week period to
find the most effective medication and dosage for you. Medications typically help manage
inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity, but the exact mechanism of action isn’t fully detailed
in the knowledge base.
As a private paying patient you will pay £499 for 3 clinics, the price of medication is based on
the dose and type of medication you need which will be discussed with you. Once you have
entered the medication pathway and we have discussed your options we will send your
prescription off to the pharmacist, we do have a partnership with Broadway pharmacist but it is
up to you who we send your prescription to. Once your prescription is with the pharmacist they
will reach out and send you a payment link. Once you have paid, your prescription will be sent to
your front door. If you need more than 3 clinics then additional clinics can be purchased for
£140. A repeat prescription is charged at £20. Additionally if you miss a clinic we will need to
charge you for an additional clinic as we still need to pay our clinician for their time.

13. What are the side effects of ADHD medication?
The knowledge base does not provide a list of medication side effects. It only mentions that we
must review your Summary Care Record (SCR) and health information to ensure it is safe for
you, considering any contraindications or interactions. For details on side effects, we recommend
discussing with one of our clinicians or a qualified healthcare professional.
Side effects may occur early during treatment with ADHD medication. These side effects are
typically mild and don’t last long. They may resolve after a few weeks of treatment as your body
adjusts to the medication. Rarely, they can be more severe or last longer. The most common side
effects of ADHD medications include:
•
Decreased appetite. Decreased appetite affects about 80% of people who take stimulant
medications.• Weight loss. You may be able to manage any unintended weight loss by taking your
medication after meals or adding protein shakes or snacks to your diet.
• Difficulty sleeping. It may take you longer to fall asleep and stay asleep. Overall, you
may experience poorer quality sleep. The timing of when you take medications during the
day, especially extended release, can help reduce this side effect.
Other ADHD medication side effects may include:
• Rebound effect. A short period of fatigue, increased activity or a bad mood as the
medication wears off.
• Anxiety. New or increased anxiety and depression.
• Tics. Sudden, repetitive movements or sounds such as eye blinking or throat clearing.
ADHD medication doesn’t cause tics, but it may make them more noticeable than they’d
be without medication.
• Minor growth delay. Some children and adolescents who take stimulants experience
growth reduction, but it doesn’t affect their final height.
• Upset stomach. This may include nausea and vomiting.
• Changes in blood pressure and heart rate. Blood pressure may go up or down,
depending on the medication. Stimulant medications can also increase your heart rate
slightly. The increase is usually minor and not dangerous, but you should tell your
healthcare provider if you or your child have a history of heart problems.
Side effects that don’t go away after a few weeks of treatment may be relieved by:
• Changing your medication dosage or schedule.
• Changing to an extended-release formulation.
• Using a different stimulant medication.
• Trying a non-stimulant medication.
If you do experience any side effects that you don’t like we would ask you to stop taking your
medication and review these side effects with your clinician at your next appointment.

14. Are there non-medication therapies or coaching available?
Yes. We offer a 12-week programme via the Care ADHD App, which includes CBT-informed
modules and daily wellness tasks, plus a coach available through the app’s chat function. This
programme is priced at £230 and is designed to help you build strategies to manage ADHD
beyond medication. As part of our coaching programme we will work with you to help you
identify your goals, you will meet with your coach throughout the 12 week and will be able to
access them through the chat function of the app. Your coach can also help you to complete the‘Access to work grant’ which can enable you to gain access to more coaching as well as
equipment that can support you to work.

15. How do you monitor patients once they start treatment?
After diagnosis, if you opt for medication, you’ll go through a 12-week titration period. During
this time, our Clinical Care Hub checks in with you through virtual clinics to adjust dosages as
needed. As part of the medication pathway you will be required to fill out a form that asks you
for your physical health including blood pressure If you’re doing coaching or psychological
support, you’ll also have regular engagement via our app. It’s all remote, so you can be anywhere
in the UK.

16. Does an ADHD diagnosis impact life insurance or job applications?
Our knowledge base does not discuss specific impacts on life insurance or job applications.
Therefore, we don’t have any information on that topic in our database.
It is very difficult to predict whether or not an ADHD diagnosis would impact on your life
insurance or job applications. When you are applying for life insurance in the UK, having ADHD
can come up in the questions. This is usually in the questions about if you have ever seen a
psychiatrist and any regular medication that you are taking. When looking into life insurance for
someone living with ADHD, you may be able to find a policy that is offered at standard terms. This
means that there will likely not be any exclusions or any premium increases.
This does depend on any medication or treatments that you are currently taking and/or
undergoing. The terms of the policy will also depend on how much ADHD affects your day-to-
day ability to do things.
You do not have to declare a disability when applying for a job in the UK; disclosing your
disability is a personal choice, and you are not legally obligated to inform an employer until they
make you a job offer, unless it's necessary to discuss reasonable adjustments for the application
process

17. Can I still drive or hold a driver’s licence with ADHD?
This question is not directly covered in the knowledge base. We do not have any specific
information about driving regulations for individuals with ADHD.
It is commonly misunderstood that if you are diagnosed with ADHD you must tell the DVLA.
The truth is that the DVLA only need to be informed if you feel your ADHD or ADHD
medication may impair your driving. If you have ADHD and think your symptoms affect your
ability to drive safely, you should inform the DVLA. You can do this by completing a
confidential medical form18. Will my employer or school need to be informed about my diagnosis?
We do not require you to inform employers or educational institutions. However, if you wish to
seek accommodations or adjustments, our formal diagnosis letter can help. Our knowledge base
mentions that you will receive a formal diagnosis letter, which you can share with a workplace or
educational institution if you choose—but it’s up to you.

19. How do I access support for ADHD in school or the workplace?
Our knowledge base focuses on adult assessments, so it doesn’t outline specific steps for
academic or workplace accommodations. Generally, the formal diagnosis letter can be used to
request any adjustments you feel you need, but we don’t have further details on this in our
database.
You can access support for ADHD in the workplace through the government's Access to Work
scheme:
1. Apply for support
You can apply for an Access to Work grant online. You can also call the Access to Work helpline
at 0800 121 7479 to check your eligibility.

• A phased return to work
We are very happy to support you to complete the access to work application if you would like
any help I can email one of our coaches for you.

20. How can I get help managing the costs of treatment?
If you qualify for the NHS Right to Choose route, the NHS covers the cost of your assessment
and titration. You’d only cover the NHS prescription charge (around £9.80) for medication.
Privately, Care ADHD partners with Clearpay and Klarna to allow payment in instalments for the
£299 assessment or the £499 titration package.

21. Is Care ADHD part of the NHS ‘Right to Choose’ pathway?
Yes. Our knowledge base confirms that Care ADHD holds an NHS contract allowing patients to
use their Right to Choose for ADHD assessments and treatments with us, provided they have a
GP referral and meet the relevant criteria.

22. How do I book an appointment with Care ADHD?
You can book in two ways:
• Private: Go to our website, register, and pay the £299. We’ll send you the questionnaires
within working hours which are Monday to Friday 9am to 5pm and then schedule your
online assessment.
• NHS Right to Choose: Ask your GP to refer you to Care ADHD. Once we receive the
referral, we’ll send you login details for our portal and get you booked in.

23. What qualifications do Care ADHD clinicians have?
All clinicians are trained and experienced in assessing ADHD according to NICE guidelines.
They may be on different professional registers (like the GMC or NMC), but each is qualified to
provide an ADHD diagnosis and treatment. Our Chairman and Medical Director are GMC-
registered, but the assessing clinician may be registered with another appropriate professional
body.

24. How do I provide feedback or raise concerns about my care?
This isn’t detailed in the knowledge base. We can, however, direct you to contact us by phone at
0204 525 0709 or by email at enquiries@careadhd.co.uk, as stated in the knowledge base. If you
have a specific concern, you can email or call, and we will ensure your feedback is escalated to
the relevant team member.

25. Can you help with ADHD-related mental health issues, like anxiety or depression?
We do assess comorbid conditions using tools such as PHQ-9 (for depression) and GAD-7 (for
anxiety) as part of our assessment. While our main focus is ADHD, we do identify symptoms of
anxiety or depression and can incorporate that into the overall picture of your care. For
specialised or ongoing mental health support beyond ADHD, we may advise discussing options
with your GP or a specialist, because the knowledge base doesn’t mention in-depth treatment for
conditions other than ADHD.
